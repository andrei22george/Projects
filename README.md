# Projects
a brief of all my computer science related projects.
  
## *MySQL and Java (JavaFX)*. University Management Platform
  - developed an application for managing an University with a partener as part of my Databases class
  - implemented a database with users (students, professors, admins, superadmins)
  - each user has specific privileges and features (e.g., see personal data, join courses, create / join groups, send messages, create activities, update data etc.)
  - implemented user interface for each role using JavaFX

## *C++*. Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis
  - used C++ to implement various Data Structures and Algorithms such as Heaps, Trees, Sorting Methods, Hash Tabeles, Disjoint Sets, Graph algorithms (Kruskal, Tarjan, BFS, DFS)
  - analised each one on randomly generated test cases
  - generated graphs that show the performance on each one for an increasing number of tests
  - part of a lab assignment with final grade: 10.00/10.00

## *Java*. Sliding Puzzle Game
  - a 3 x 3 Sliding Puzzle created in Java as part of my OOP class
  - uses Java Swing for the GUI
  - 9 squared pictures, randomly shuffled, displays a complete picture when solved
  - displays win / lose message depending on the number of moves 

## *Assembly*. Battleships
  - battleships game made using Assembly as part of my Assembly Language Programming class
  - uses a custom framework for creating the user interface
  - i implemented both the user interface and the game in a 8 x 8 and 10 x 10 board
  - prints win / lose messages depending on the number of hits / misses

## *VHDL*. Elevator
  - elevator project made with a partener during my Digital System Design class
  - was implemented on a Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA Board
  - its goal is to simulate the fuctionality of an elevator
  - has different sensors (simulated) such as weight limiter, doors can't close while a person is standing in the door
